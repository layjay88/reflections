How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

It allowed me to compare 2 programs side by side, which in turn made it extremely easy to see the mistake that was made given the +/- signs.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

It would make it easy to go back to a previous working version of a program as to pin point mistakes quicker and more effctively.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?

Pros: Logical per user opinion; Can leave helpful comments
Cons: Might forget; Too many saved commits
